File ID: SW-∆/DESERT-CLASSIFIED
Unauthorized access punishable under Global Security Statute 7A

Subject: Skinwalkers

Internal Designation: Type-SH (Shapeshifter Hostile)
Origin Region: Southwestern territories of Navajo Nation
Status: Active (Unconfirmed Density)

1. Overview

“Skinwalker” is the English rendering of a forbidden term within Navajo Nation tradition. The original name is not spoken in secure documentation.

Officially: dismissed as folklore.
Unofficially: categorized as hostile occult practitioner with adaptive morphology capability.

Field reports spanning over a century indicate recurring patterns consistent enough to warrant archival containment rather than dismissal.



2. Foundational Profile

A Skinwalker is believed to be a human practitioner who has undergone a ritual inversion process—deliberately violating sacred cultural laws to obtain transformation abilities.

Primary capability:

- Assumption of animal form (coyote, wolf, owl most common)
- Partial morph states (hybrid configurations reported)
- Voice mimicry of known individuals
- Psychological projection (induced dread, paralysis, hallucination)
- Unlike mythic shapeshifters, these entities are not born—they are made.



3. Transformation Mechanics (Unverified)

Recovered testimonies describe:

- Use of animal hides during transitional state
- Ritual isolation in desert regions
- Sacrificial rites tied to lunar cycles
- Consumption of specific herbal compounds

Biological feasibility remains unproven. However, witnesses consistently report anatomical distortions inconsistent with costume or prosthetic deception.

Notable features during unstable morph states:

- Eyes reflecting light at impossible angles
- Limbs bending contrary to skeletal norms
- Vocal emissions overlapping animal and human frequencies



4. Behavioral Patterns

Skinwalkers reportedly:

- Stalk remote homesteads
- Circle vehicles at night
- Tap on windows without visible source
- Call victims by name using familiar voices
- Primary objective appears psychological destabilization prior to direct engagement.
- Physical attacks are rare but documented in redacted tribal records.



5. Geographic Clusters

High-frequency incident zones:

- Desert regions of Arizona
- Northern New Mexico
- Southern Utah

Special attention: Proximity to Skinwalker Ranch
Though publicly associated with UFO phenomena, classified cross-analysis suggests overlapping anomaly categories.



6. Avoidance Protocol (Traditional Countermeasures)

Local advisories include:

- Do not respond to voices outside after dark.
- Do not maintain eye contact with anomalous animals.
- Do not speak of them directly (belief: attention invites presence).
- Protective ash or ceremonial blessings reportedly reduce encounter probability.

Internal memo annotation: Cultural countermeasures correlate with lower reported incident recurrence.



7. Psychological Signature

Victims consistently describe:

- Sudden oppressive silence in natural environments
- Electrical interference
- Acute dread preceding visual contact
- Persistent feeling of being watched for days afterward
- Medical evaluations show elevated cortisol levels and sleep disruption, even when no physical evidence is recovered.



8. Threat Assessment

Risk Level: Moderate in populated areas / Elevated in isolated terrain.

Primary hazard is cognitive destabilization, not mass casualty events.
Objective appears territorial, not expansionist.

Motivation remains unknown.



9. Suppression Status

Public narrative classifies Skinwalkers as folklore to prevent:

- Tourism-driven provocation
- Cultural desecration
- Panic in rural communities
- Internal note: The strongest containment tool remains ridicule.
